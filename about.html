          <p>  Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Luv and I'm a 20-year-old student based in Pune.
            I created this website as a way to share my experiences and showcase my skills. As a student,
            I'm constantly learning and exploring new topics,
            and I decided to learn HTML as a way to develop my web development skills and build something that I could be proud of.
            When I'm not studying or coding,
            I enjoy bike rides. Through this website, I hope to connect with others who share my passions and interests,
            and I'm excited to share my journey with you. Thanks for visiting!
          </p>
